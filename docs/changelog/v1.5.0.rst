.. _v1.5.0:

1.5.0
=====

Fixes
.....

* Fixed the :class:`~pynetdicom.transport.AssociationServer` not properly
  closing its sockets (:issue:`382`)
* Improved the robustness of determining the local IP address (:issue:`394`)

Enhancements
............

* Added configuration option :attr:`_config.USE_SHORT_DIMSE_AET
  <pynetdicom._config.USE_SHORT_DIMSE_AET>` so elements with a VR of *AE* in
  DIMSE messages are only padded to the shortest even length rather than to
  the maximum 16 characters. (:issue:`403`)

Changes
.......

.. currentmodule:: pynetdicom.association

* Using a key that corresponds to a given UID with
  :meth:`Association.send_c_find`, :meth:`Association.send_c_get` and
  :meth:`Association.send_c_move` removed as per planned deprecation. Use the
  UID directly instead.
* Python 3.4 is no longer officially supported, Python 3.7 is now officially
  supported
