.. _v1.2.0:

1.2.0
=====

Fixes
.....
* Fixed ``network_timeout`` not working when acting as the association requestor
  and an A-ABORT not being sent when the timeout expired. (:issue:`286`)
* Fixed changing ``network_timeout`` value not propagating to the actual timer.
* All DIMSE service requests should now properly abort the association if no
  response is received within the DIMSE timeout window and return/yield
  expected values. (:issue:`119`)
* Any outgoing primitives are now sent to the peer before incoming PDUs are
  processed (:issue:`120`)
* Fixed not setting requestor presentation context roles to False when only
  one role is specified during Role Selection negotiation. (:issue:`293`)


Enhancements
............

* Added ``_config`` module and the ability to skip the dataset decoding step in
  C-STORE operations by setting ``_config.DECODE_STORE_DATASETS`` to False
  (:issue:`282`)
* Consolidated and improved the robustness of the transport related code
  (:issue:`42`):

  * Added ``transport`` module
  * Added ``AssociationSocket`` class that wraps a client ``socket.socket`` to
    provide integration with the Association state machine. In particular all
    receive and send operations should emit state machine event 'Evt17' when
    the connection is closed. (:issue:`204`)
  * Added ``AssociationServer``, and ``ThreadedAssociationServer`` classes
    to provide association acceptor services.
  * ``fsm.AE_1`` is now properly implemented and state machine event 'Evt2' is
    now emitted in a non-trivial manner.
  * Added ``AE.start_server()`` which allows operation in both blocking and
    non-blocking modes.
  * Added ``AE.shutdown()`` which allows the user to shutdown all non-blocking
    association servers that may be running.
  * Support for TLS added via the ``tls_args`` keyword parameter for
    ``AE.associate()`` and ``ssl_context`` keyword parameter for
    ``AE.start_server()`` (:pr:`175`, :pr:`71`)
  * It should now be possible to both request a C-MOVE operation and act as the
    destination for the request's C-STORE sub-operations over a new association
    within the same AE instance by running a non-blocking Storage SCP.
    (:issue:`5`, :issue:`181`)
* Received P-DATA primitives are now processed when received rather than when
  processing is requested.
* Added ``DIMSEServiceProvider.get_msg()``,
  ``DIMSEServiceProvider.receive_primitive()``,
  ``DIMSEServiceProvider.peek_msg()`` and ``DIMSEServiceProvider.msg_queue``
  to be used with the new P-DATA processing.
* Time required to start an association improved significantly.
* Implemented C-CANCEL support

  * Added ``ServiceClass.is_cancelled()`` method to allow
    checking whether a C-CANCEL message corresponding to a message ID value
    has been received.
  * Added 'cancelled' key to the ``info`` parameter passed to
    ``AE.on_c_get()``, ``AE.on_c_find()`` and ``AE.on_c_move()``. The
    corresponding value is a callable function (``is_cancelled()``) that
    takes a *Message ID* value and returns True if a C-CANCEL message with
    a corresponding *Message ID Being Responded To* value has been received.
* Added thread names ('threadtype@timestamp').
* Added ``build_role()`` to simplify creating SCP/SCU Role Selection
  Negotiation items.


Changes
.......

* ``AE.quit()``, ``DIMSEMessage.ID``, ``ACSE.is_released()`` and
  ``ACSE.release_association()`` removed as per planned deprecation.
* ``AE.start()`` is deprecated and will be removed in v1.3, use
  ``AE.start_server()`` instead.
* ``AE.stop()`` is deprecated and will be removed in v1.3, use
  ``AE.shutdown()`` instead.
* The ``AE.port`` property and ``port`` argument for ``AE()`` are deprecated
  and will be removed in v1.3. Use the ``address`` parameter for
  ``AE.start_server()`` and the ``bind_address`` keyword parameter for
  ``AE.associate()`` instead.
* The ``AE.local_socket`` attribute is deprecated and will be removed in v1.3.
* The ``AE.address`` attribute is deprecated and will be removed in v1.3.
* The ``AE.bind_addr`` attribute is deprecated and will be removed in v1.3. Use
  the ``address`` parameter for ``AE.start_server()`` and the ``bind_address``
  keyword parameter for ``AE.associate()`` instead.
* Changed the default DIMSE timeout to 30 s.
* Changed the default number of maximum associations to 10.
* The ``acse_timeout`` parameter to ``ACSE()`` and ``ACSE.acse_timeout``
  attribute removed, the ``Association.acse_timeout`` value is used instead.
* ``AE.active_associations`` changed from an attribute to a property and
  returns a list of all the AE's active Association threads.
* ``AE.associate()`` is now synchronous until association negotiation has
  completed or the connection closed (:issue:`108`).
* Removed ``DIMSEServiceProvider.receive_msg()``.
* ``Association.send_c_cancel_get()``, ``send_c_cancel_find()`` and
  ``send_c_cancel_move()`` are deprecated and will be removed in v1.3. Use
  ``Association.send_c_cancel()`` instead.
* Removed ``AE.on_c_get_cancel()``, ``AE.on_c_find_cancel()``,
  ``AE.on_c_move_cancel()``.
