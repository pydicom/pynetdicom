1.1.0
=====

Fixes
.....

* No longer using a list as the default value for the ``transfer_syntax``
  keyword argument in ``AE.add_requested_context()``,
  ``AE.add_supported_context()`` and ``presentation.build_context()``
* Completely fixed handling a maximum PDU length of 0. (:issue:`193`)
* ``DIMSEMessage`` subclass creation and ``DIMSEMessage.primitive_to_message``
  should now be thread-safe (:issue:`137`)
* Fixed ``ACSE.send_ap_abort`` not working correctly (:pull_request:`268`).

Enhancements
............

* Added ``select_timeout`` parameter to ``Association.start()`` to allow the
  user to specify how long the select.select() call blocks for.
  (:pull_request:`260`)
* Improved the CPU usage of the AE when running idle as an SCP (:issue:`60`).


Changes
.......

* ``AE.quit()`` is deprecated and will be removed in v1.2. Use ``AE.stop()``
  instead.
* ``DIMSEMessage.ID`` is deprecated and will be removed in v1.2. Use
  ``DIMSEMessage.context_id`` instead.
* Added ``_globals.py`` for frequently used global constants.
* ``utils.validate_ae_title`` changed to only return bytes for Python 3
* ``AE.require_calling_aet`` now takes a list of AE titles (as bytes) rather
  than a single AE title. If set to a non-empty list then association requests
  will be rejected unless the value of the *Calling AE Title* parameter matches
  one of those in the list. If set to an empty list (default) then all
  associations will be accepted (unless rejected for other reasons).
  (:issue:`192`)
* ``AE.require_called_aet`` should now be set using a bool. If True then any
  association requests will be rejected unless the value of the *Called AE
  Title* parameter matches ``AE.ae_title``. If False (default) then no matching
  will be performed and all associations accepted (unless rejected for other
  reasons). (:issue:`184`)
* The association acceptor no longer aborts an accepted association if there
  are no accepted presentation contexts. The association requestor still does.
