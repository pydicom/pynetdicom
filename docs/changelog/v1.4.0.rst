.. _v1.4.0:

1.4.0
=====


Fixes
.....

* Fixed Query Retrieve service class not responded with ``0x0000`` (Success)
  if no matches were yielded by the C-FIND request handler.
* Fixed association being aborted due to failure to decode a rejected
  presentation context when the transfer syntax value is empty (:issue:`342`)
* Checkpoint added to the reactor in ``Association`` to prevent a possible
  race condition when acting as the Acceptor and calling one of the
  ``Association.send_*()`` methods.


Enhancements
............

* Added support for Protocol Approval Query Retrieve service class
  (:issue:`327`)
* Added ``Event.move_destination`` property


Changes
.......

* The following have been removed as per planned deprecation:
  * ``AE.on_c_store()``, ``AE.on_c_echo()``, ``AE.on_c_find()``,
    ``AE.on_c_get()``, ``AE.on_c_move()``, ``AE.on_n_get()``,
    ``AE.on_async_ops_window()``, ``AE.on_sop_class_common_extended()``,
    ``AE.on_sop_class_extended()``, ``AE.on_user_identity()``,
    ``AE.on_association_accepted()``, ``AE.on_association_rejected()``,
    ``AE.on_association_released()``, ``AE.on_association_aborted()``,
  * ``_config.DECODE_STORE_DATASETS``
  * ``DIMSEServiceProvider.on_send_dimse_message()``,
    ``DIMSEServiceProvider.on_receive_dimse_message()``
  * ``Association.send_c_find()``, ``Association.send_c_get()`` and
    ``Association.send_c_move()`` now require a `query_model` parameter that
    is used to set the *Affected SOP Class UID* value. The parameter should
    pass a pydicom UID or UID string. Passing a key that corresponds to a given
    UID is deprecated and will be removed in v1.5. (:issue:`348`)
