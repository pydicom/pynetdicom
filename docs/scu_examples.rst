Verification SCU
================
The most basic way of verifying and troubleshooting a connection with a peer
Application Entity (AE) is to send a DICOM C-ECHO, which utilises the
*Verification SOP Class*

.. code-block:: python

        from pynetdicom3 import AE

        ae = AE()
        # Verification SOP Class has a UID of 1.2.840.10008.1.1
        ae.add_requested_context('1.2.840.10008.1.1')

        # Try and associate with the peer AE
        #   Returns the Association thread
        print('Requesting Association with the peer')
        assoc = ae.associate(addr, port)

        if assoc.is_established:
            print('Association accepted by the peer')
            # Send a DIMSE C-ECHO request to the peer
            # status is a pydicom Dataset object with (at a minimum) a
            # (0000, 0900) Status element
            status = assoc.send_c_echo()

            # Output the response from the peer
            if status:
                print('C-ECHO Response: 0x{0:04x}'.format(status.Status))

            # Release the association
            assoc.release()
        elif assoc.is_rejected:
            print('Association was rejected by the peer')
        elif assoc.is_aborted:
            print('Received an A-ABORT from the peer during Association')

Storage SCU
===========
A common use of a DICOM SCU is to use a DICOM C-STORE message to send DICOM
datasets to peer AEs.

.. code-block:: python

        from pydicom import read_file
        from pynetdicom3 import AE, StoragePresentationContexts

        ae = AE()
        # StoragePresentationContexts is a list of PresentationContexts, one
        #   for each of the Storage Service's SOP Classes (see PS3.4 Annex B.5)
        ae.requested_contexts = StoragePresentationContexts

        # Try and associate with the peer AE
        #   Returns the Association thread
        print('Requesting Association with the peer')
        assoc = ae.associate(addr, port)

        if assoc.is_established:
            print('Association accepted by the peer')

            # Read the DICOM dataset from file 'dcmfile'
            dataset = read_file('dcmfile')

            # Send a DIMSE C-STORE request to the peer
            status = assoc.send_c_store(dataset)
            print('C-STORE status: %s' %status)

            # Release the association
            assoc.release()


Query/Retrieve - Find SCU
=========================
Query the peer AE to see if it contains any Instances with attributes matching
those specified by the user-created *dataset*.

.. code-block:: python

        from pydicom.dataset import Dataset

        from pynetdicom3 import AE, QueryRetrievePresentationContexts

        ae = AE()

        # QueryRetrievePresentationContexts is a list of PresentationContexts,
        #   one for each of the Query/Retrieve Service's SOP Classes
        #   (see PS3.4 Annex C.6)

        # Try and associate with the peer AE
        #   Returns the Association thread
        print('Requesting Association with the peer')
        assoc = ae.associate(addr, port)

        if assoc.is_established:
            print('Association accepted by the peer')

            # Create a new DICOM dataset with the attributes to match against
            #   In this case match any patient's name at the PATIENT query
            #   level. See PS3.4 Annex C.6 for the complete list of possible
            #   attributes and query levels.
            dataset = Dataset()
            dataset.PatientName = '*'
            dataset.QueryRetrieveLevel = "PATIENT"

            # Send a DIMSE C-FIND request to the peer
            #   query_model is the Query/Retrieve Information Model to use
            #   and is one of 'W', 'P', 'S', 'O'
            #       'W' - Modality Worklist (1.2.840.10008.5.1.4.31)
            #       'P' - Patient Root (1.2.840.10008.5.1.4.1.2.1.1)
            #       'S' - Study Root (1.2.840.10008.5.1.4.1.2.2.1)
            #       'O' - Patient/Study Only (1.2.840.10008.5.1.4.1.2.3.1)
            responses = assoc.send_c_find(dataset, query_model='P')

            for (status, identifier) in responses:
                # While status is pending we should get the matching datasets
                if status == 'Pending':
                    print(identifier)
                elif status == 'Success':
                    print('C-FIND finished, releasing the association')
                elif status == 'Cancel':
                    print('C-FIND cancelled, releasing the association')
                elif status == 'Failure':
                    print('C-FIND failed, releasing the association')

            # Release the association
            assoc.release()
