* The following changes have been made in order to support IPv6 connections:

  * Changed :meth:`AE.associate()<pynetdicom.ae.ApplicationEntity.associate>` to accept
    either a str or tuple[str, int, int] as the `addr` parameter.
  * Changed :meth:`AE.associate()<pynetdicom.ae.ApplicationEntity.associate>` to accept
    either a tuple[str, int] or tuple[str, int, int, int] as the `bind_address` keyword
    parameter.
  * Changed :meth:`AE.make_server()<pynetdicom.ae.ApplicationEntity.associate>` and
    :meth:`AE.start_server()<pynetdicom.ae.ApplicationEntity.associate>` to
    accept either a tuple[str, int] or tuple[str, int, int, int] as the `address`
    parameter.
  * Added :class:`~pynetdicom.transport.AddressInformation`
  * :attr:`ServiceUser.address<pynetdicom.association.ServiceUser.address>` and
    :attr:`ServiceUser.port<pynetdicom.association.ServiceUser.port>` are now
    read-only properties.
  * Added :attr:`ServiceUser.address_info
    <pynetdicom.association.ServiceUser.address_info>`.
  * Changed :meth:`pynetdicom.transport.AssociationSocket` to accept an
    :class:`~pynetdicom.transport.AddressInformation` instance as the `address`
    keyword parameter.
  * :attr:`RequestHandler.local<pynetdicom.transport.RequestHandler.local>` and
    :attr:`RequestHandler.remote<pynetdicom.transport.RequestHandler.remote>` now
    return an :class:`~pynetdicom.transport.AddressInformation` instance
  * Added :attr:`T_CONNECT.address_info<pynetdicom.transport.T_CONNECT.address_info>`
  * :attr:`A_ASSOCIATE.calling_presentation_address
    <pynetdicom.pdu_primitives.A_ASSOCIATE.calling_presentation_address>` and
    :attr:`A_ASSOCIATE.called_presentation_address
    <pynetdicom.pdu_primitives.A_ASSOCIATE.called_presentation_address>` are both now
    set using an :class:`~pynetdicom.transport.AddressInformation` instance

* Added the `block` optional argument to :meth:`Association.abort()
  <pynetdicom.association.Association.abort>` to allow for operation in non-blocking
  mode.


Enhancements
------------

* Setting the *Affected SOP Instance UID* for an N-CREATE-RSP message when it's
  absent from the N-CREATE-RQ can now be done by adding it to the returned *Attribute
  List* dataset (it'll be removed from the dataset prior to sending) (:issue:`995`)
* Added debugging handlers for the remaining DIMSE-N messages
* Added support for IPv6 connections (:issue:`984`)


Fixes
-----
* Fixed a state machine error caused by receiving N-EVENT-REPORT requests during
  association release (:issue:`820`)
* Added redundancy to ensure sockets are closed during abort and connection failure
  (:issue:`979`)
* Handle an exception due to the socket being discarded while trying to send an abort
  while waiting for the socket to be discarded ðŸ™ƒ (:issue:`806`)
* Fixed :meth:`Association.abort()<pynetdicom.association.Association.abort>` causing
  a deadlock when called within event handlers (:issue:`912`)
